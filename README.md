This is my PyTorch Implementation of [Random Network Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12894.pdf) with
a Dueling Double DQN. The papers associated with this algorithm can be found here:

[Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581.pdf)
[Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf)

This implementation only supports Unity's Obstacle Tower environment. Instructions for setting up the environment,
as well as more information about the environment, can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/obstacle-tower-env)

This was done for a class project (Brown University's CSCI-2951K: Topics in Collaborative Robotics), and my final paper for
the class can be found in this repo.

Setup.py is a modification of Pytorch's DQN implementation found in their [Deep RL Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html)
